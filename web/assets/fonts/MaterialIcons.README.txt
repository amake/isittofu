MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf is included as a workaround due to a bug(?) in flutter web:
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/32540

It was taken from the 2.2.0 release:
https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/ac75e8329cc936816f1c5e2de182858efe7530ab/iconfont/MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf
